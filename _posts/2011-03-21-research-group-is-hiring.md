Hi everyone, I&#8217;m posting this at our Faculty Advisor&#8217;s (Professor David Brumley) request.

If you are interested in the following position, please contact him!

> **Job Opening (Staff Programmer)**
> 
> We&#8217;re looking for great systems programmers to work on automatic program exploitation and program analysis problems. We need strong programmers with an emphasis on systems-level knowledge (knowing how a program gets compiled down, unix, etc.). Being able to reverse engineer binaries and write exploits against program binaries is a plus. Experience with writing compilers/optimizations, or program verification is also a plus. We write our code in C and OCaml. The position is at Carnegie Mellon University in CyLab (<a href="http://www.cylab.cmu.edu" target="_blank">www.cylab.cmu.edu</a>) with Prof. David Brumley. You&#8217;d also be working with CMU PhD students and undergrads. To get a sense of the security projects, visit <a href="http://security.ece.cmu.edu" target="_blank">http://security.ece.cmu.edu</a>.
