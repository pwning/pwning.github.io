## Twitter

The easiest way to get in touch with us is often via twitter through the [@plaidctf](http://twitter.com/plaidctf) handle. We will try to respond to direct messages as quickly as possible.



<!-- Do we want to include this, the email *is* public, but it seems like this might be worth keeping private -->

## Email

You can also email us at [plaid.parliament.of.pwning@gmail.com](mailto:plaid.parliament.of.pwning@gmail.com). We will still try to be responsive, but may be slower responding to these. 

## Current Students

We meet at CIC DEC 1201 most Fridays, at 5:00 pm (ET). We also have a [mailing list](https://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/plaid-parliament-pwning) that you can join to receive information about upcoming meetings. Be sure to use your Andrew email to subscribe.
